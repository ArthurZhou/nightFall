[00:19.138]The darkest hour is nearing
[00:22.074]In silence we drowning
[00:25.476]Hear the knell of death draw nigh
[00:28.917]Beneath the shattered heaven
[00:32.963]Holding our faith
[00:35.522]Through the tears it shines
[00:39.092]Only way out but I don't wanna take it
[00:41.344]Buried lie and we too scared to shake it
[00:43.928]Ooh our fate is sinking
[00:46.297]And this time we'll fight it
[00:48.879]From up high they jeer at our frailty
[00:51.559]Burning lands not worth their empathy
[00:56.005]But you can be my saving light
[01:00.225]Strike like the thunder
[01:02.702]Stay together
[01:05.243]Burn up the fire
[01:07.683]Never say never
[01:10.275]Save us save us
[01:13.032]Saving light
[01:14.721]
[01:34.680]Only way out but I don't wanna take it
[01:37.109]Buried lie and we too scared to shake it
[01:39.565]Ooh our fate is sinking
[01:41.701]And this time we'll fight it
[01:44.481]From up high they jeer at our frailty
[01:47.148]Burning lands not worth their empathy
[01:51.578]But I can be your saving light
[01:55.747]
[02:21.636]No more fear
[02:23.449]We're ushering a new world
[02:25.629]Revolution it's our call
[02:28.280]Tragedies in repetition
[02:30.718]We'll show them how we defy
[02:33.415]Shattering the darkness
[02:35.805]I will lead you through the night
[02:38.325]Together face it
[02:41.059]We will be the saving light
